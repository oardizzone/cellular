# Cellular

Inspired by TheCodingTrain's video on cellular automata, this is an implementation of Conways Game of Life, sketched out in P5JS, then implemented in React and Angular.

## React

Can be hosted using by changing directory to `gol-react` and then running:
```
npm run build
npx serve build
```

## Angular

Not implemented yet, will be added soon.
